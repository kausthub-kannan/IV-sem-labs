What Is a Medium Shot?
A medium shot, also called a mid-shot or waist shot, is a type of camera shot in film and television that shows an actor approximately from the waist up. A medium shot is used to emphasize both the actor and their surroundings by giving them an equal presence on screen. The director of photography uses a medium shot to clearly show the actor's face and emotions while still informing the audience of what’s going on in the world around them.

8 Different Types of Medium Shots
There are eight common types of medium shots.

1. Medium close-up shot: somewhere between a close-up shot and a medium shot, showing the subject from the chest or shoulders up and not revealing a lot of the surrounding environment.
2. Medium shot: somewhere between a close-up and a wide shot, showing the subject from the waist up while revealing some of the surrounding environment.
3. Medium long shot: somewhere between a medium shot and a full shot, showing the subject from the knees up. Also called a ¾ shot.
4. Over-the-shoulder shot: the camera is positioned behind or over the shoulder of one subject while the other subject is still visible on screen, emphasizing the connection between the characters.
5. Two-shot: two subjects appear side by side or facing one another in a single frame.
6. Point of view shot: shows the action through the eyes of a specific character, essentially letting the audience become that character.
7. High-angle shot: Used to indicate the balance of power between characters. In high-angle shots, the audience looks down on the subject, giving the audience a sense of superiority.
8. Low-angle shot: Used to indicate the balance of power between characters. In low-angle shots, the audience looks up at the subject, giving the audience a sense of inferiority.
